Lots of fun stuffs about Scientific Computing!

I am very interested in Scientific Computing, which includes
Mathematics, Informatics, and anything you want.

## What will this repo contain? 
The main idea is to upload all jupyter notebooks with useful stuff that might i use in future
sure it's not perfect and prob i will not use it but something is something

First set of notebook is out!!
